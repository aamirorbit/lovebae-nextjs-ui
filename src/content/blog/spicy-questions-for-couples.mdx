Sometimes your conversations need a little extra heat. Whether you've been together for a few months or several years, spicy questions can reignite the passion and help you discover new things about each other.

## Why Spicy Questions Matter

Beyond the obvious fun factor, intimate questions:
- Build emotional and physical connection
- Create anticipation and excitement
- Help partners communicate desires openly
- Break down barriers and build trust
- Keep the relationship fresh and exciting

## Getting Started: Setting the Mood

Before diving in, create the right atmosphere:
- Put your phones away (except for Lovebae, of course!)
- Pour your favorite drinks
- Dim the lights or light some candles
- Make it a judgment-free zone
- Remember: you can always skip a question
