- "What is your most treasured memory?"
- "What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?"

### 7. Lovebae Check-In Challenge

Use Lovebae's daily check-in feature to spark conversation, then expand on your answers together. Share your moods, answer the daily question, and discuss what you learned about each other.

### 8. Memory Lane

Each person writes down 5 memories from your relationship on paper. Mix them up and take turns reading them aloud, sharing what made that moment special.

### 9. The Appreciation Game

Set a timer for 2 minutes. Take turns saying one thing you appreciate about each other until time runs out. No repeating!

### 10. Dream Life Planning

Grab paper and separately write down:
- Where you want to live

- Family plans
- Retirement dreams

Compare and discuss. You might be surprised how aligned (or hilariously different) your visions are!
