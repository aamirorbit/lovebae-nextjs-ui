Whether you've been together for two months or twenty years, there's always more to learn about each other. Questions are the gateway to deeper connection, hilarious discoveries, and meaningful conversations.

## Why Couple Questions Work

Questions do more than pass time — they:
- Break the routine of everyday conversation
- Reveal new sides of each other
- Create opportunities for deeper intimacy
- Build shared memories and inside jokes
- Strengthen emotional connection

## Never Have I Ever — Couples Edition

These questions are perfect for a fun, revealing game night:

1. Never have I ever stalked my partner's social media before we started dating
2. Never have I ever pretended to like something just because my partner liked it
3. Never have I ever secretly eaten my partner's snacks
4. Never have I ever forgotten an important date
5. Never have I ever practiced saying "I love you" before saying it the first time

## Would You Rather

Make your partner choose between two options:

1. Would you rather have dinner with my family or yours every Sunday?
2. Would you rather we live in the city or the countryside?
3. Would you rather give up Netflix or social media for a month?
4. Would you rather I plan all our dates or we take turns?
5. Would you rather know what I'm thinking or what I'm feeling?

## Deep Conversation Starters

For those moments when you want to go deeper:

- What's something you've never told anyone that you trust me enough to share?
- How do you feel most loved by me?
- What's a childhood memory that shaped who you are today?
- Where do you see us in five years?
- What's something you wish you could tell your younger self?

## Flirty & Playful Questions

Keep the spark alive:

1. What's the first thing you noticed about me?
2. What's your favorite memory of us?
3. If you could relive one day we've spent together, which would it be?
4. What's something I do that always makes you smile?
5. What's your favorite way to be kissed?

## Future Planning Questions

Dream together:

- If money wasn't an issue, where would we live?
- What traditions do you want us to have?
- How many pets do you want us to have eventually?
- What's on your bucket list that you want to do together?
- What kind of home do you dream of having?
