- Medium goals (this year)
- Big dreams (someday)

### 3. Make It Visual

## The Real Magic of a Bucket List

It's not about the experiences themselves — it's about:

- **Dreaming together** — Sharing hopes creates intimacy
- **Building anticipation** — Looking forward to things together is bonding
- **Creating memories** — Shared experiences become your story
- **Growing together** — Challenges and adventures strengthen your bond
- **Living intentionally** — Instead of letting life happen, you're designing it
