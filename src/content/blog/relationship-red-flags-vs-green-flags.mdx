In the early days of dating, everything feels exciting. It's easy to overlook warning signs or dismiss that gut feeling. But knowing the difference between red flags and green flags can save you heartbreak — or help you recognize when you've found someone special.

Let's break down what to watch for.

## What Are Red Flags and Green Flags?

**Red flags** are warning signs that something isn't right. They can indicate:
- Potential for harm (emotional, physical, or psychological)
- Incompatibility
- Unhealthy patterns
- Character issues

**Green flags** are positive signs that indicate:
- Emotional health
- Good character
- Compatibility
- Relationship potential

Both can appear early in dating or later in committed relationships. The key is knowing what to look for and trusting what you see.

## Communication Flags

### 🚩 Red Flags

**They don't listen**
You share something important and they change the subject, don't remember, or make it about themselves.

**Constant criticism disguised as "honesty"**
"I'm just being honest" shouldn't mean constantly pointing out your flaws.

**They stonewall or shut down**
Refusing to discuss issues, giving the silent treatment, or walking away during conflicts.

**Love bombing followed by withdrawal**
Overwhelming affection early on, then suddenly becoming cold or distant.

**They dismiss your feelings**
"You're overreacting," "You're too sensitive," "It's not a big deal."

### 🟢 Green Flags

**Active listening**
They remember things you've said, ask follow-up questions, and make you feel heard.

**They communicate needs directly**
Instead of expecting you to guess, they tell you what they need clearly and kindly.

**Healthy conflict resolution**
They can disagree without attacking, take breaks when needed, and come back to resolve issues.

**Consistent communication**
Their interest doesn't wildly fluctuate. They show up consistently, not just when convenient.

**They validate your feelings**
Even if they don't agree, they acknowledge that your feelings are real and valid.

## Respect Flags

### 🚩 Red Flags

**They don't respect boundaries**
You say no and they push, guilt-trip, or ignore your boundary.

**They're rude to others**
Watch how they treat servers, family, strangers. That's who they really are.

**They make you feel small**
Belittling your achievements, mocking your interests, or making you feel dumb.

**They share your private information**
Things you told them in confidence end up with their friends or on social media.

**Controlling behavior**
Telling you what to wear, who to see, checking your phone, or tracking your location.

### 🟢 Green Flags

**They respect your "no"**
When you set a boundary, they honor it without pushback or guilt.

**They're kind to everyone**
They treat the waiter, the Uber driver, and their mom with equal respect.

**They celebrate your wins**
Your success doesn't threaten them — they're genuinely happy for you.

**They protect your privacy**
What you share with them stays with them.

**They encourage your independence**
They want you to have your own friends, hobbies, and life outside the relationship.

## Trust & Honesty Flags

### 🚩 Red Flags

**Inconsistent stories**
Details change, timelines don't add up, you catch them in lies.

**They're overly secretive**
Hiding their phone, vague about where they've been, defensive when asked.

**They make you feel paranoid**
Gaslighting: "You're crazy," "That didn't happen," "I never said that."

**They talk badly about all their exes**
Everyone is "crazy" except them? The common denominator is them.

**They don't take accountability**
Everything is someone else's fault. They never apologize genuinely.

### 🟢 Green Flags

**Transparency**
You know about their life, friends, and day-to-day without having to pry.

**They admit when they're wrong**
Genuine apologies without excuses or deflection.

**Their stories are consistent**
What they tell you matches what you observe and what others say.

**They speak respectfully about exes**
They might share lessons learned without vilifying everyone.

**You feel safe trusting them**
Your gut says you can count on them, and they've earned that trust.

## Emotional Availability Flags

### 🚩 Red Flags

**Hot and cold behavior**
One day they're obsessed with you, the next they're distant or dismissive.

**They're not over their ex**
They compare you to them, still text them, or talk about them constantly.

**They avoid deep conversations**
Surface-level only. They shut down when things get real.

**They can't express feelings**
Everything is "fine," even when it clearly isn't.

**They dismiss emotional needs**
"Why do we have to talk about feelings?" or "You're too needy."

### 🟢 Green Flags

**Emotional consistency**
Their behavior is stable and predictable in a good way.

**They've processed their past**
They can talk about past relationships with perspective and lessons learned.

**They're vulnerable with you**
They share fears, insecurities, and feelings openly.

**They welcome emotional conversations**
Talking about feelings is normal, not a burden.

**They meet your emotional needs**
They make effort to show love in ways that matter to you.

## Future & Commitment Flags

### 🚩 Red Flags

**They avoid talking about the future**
Any mention of "us" long-term makes them uncomfortable or evasive.

**Misaligned core values**
Fundamental differences in kids, marriage, lifestyle, or values that can't be compromised.

**They keep you separate from their life**
You haven't met their friends, family, or been to their place after significant time.

**Undefined relationship status**
They want all the benefits without commitment or labels.

**Their words and actions don't match**
They say they want a future but don't make plans or invest in the relationship.

### 🟢 Green Flags

**They talk about the future including you**
"When we..." "Someday we could..." They see you in their tomorrow.

**Aligned core values**
You agree on the big stuff: family, finances, lifestyle, goals.

**They integrate you into their life**
You've met important people. You're part of their world.

**They're clear about commitment**
They communicate where things stand and where they're headed.

**Their actions back up their words**
When they say they care, they show it consistently.

## How to Respond to Flags

### When You See Red Flags

1. **Trust your gut** — If something feels off, it probably is.
2. **Talk about it** — Address concerns directly. Their response tells you everything.
3. **Set boundaries** — Be clear about what you will and won't accept.
4. **Seek outside perspective** — Ask trusted friends what they see.
5. **Know your dealbreakers** — Some flags warrant leaving immediately.

### When You See Green Flags

1. **Don't take them for granted** — Appreciate and reciprocate.
2. **Keep communicating** — Good relationships require ongoing effort.
3. **Share your observations** — Tell them what you value about them.
4. **Continue investing** — Green flags don't mean the work is done.
5. **Protect the relationship** — Nurture what you've found.
