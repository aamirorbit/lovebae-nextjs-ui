You're giving everything to your relationship — but somehow your partner doesn't feel loved. Meanwhile, they're doing things that don't register as love to you. What's happening?

You might be speaking different love languages.

## What Are Love Languages?

The concept comes from Dr. Gary Chapman's book "The 5 Love Languages." The idea is simple: people express and receive love differently. Understanding these differences is the key to making your partner feel truly loved.

The five love languages are:
1. Words of Affirmation
2. Quality Time
3. Physical Touch
4. Acts of Service
5. Receiving Gifts

Most people have one or two dominant love languages. When your partner "speaks" your language, you feel loved. When they don't, you might feel unloved — even if they're trying hard.

## Words of Affirmation

### What It Means

For people with this love language, words carry immense weight. Compliments, "I love you," encouragement, and verbal appreciation fill their emotional tank.

### Signs This Is Your Partner's Language:
- They light up when you compliment them
- They remember specific nice things you've said
- They're hurt by criticism or harsh words
- They frequently give compliments
- They save sweet messages and letters

### How to Speak This Language:

**Daily practices:**
- Say "I love you" — and mean it
- Compliment specific things: "I love how kind you were to that stranger"
- Express gratitude: "Thank you for always making coffee"
- Encourage their dreams: "I believe in you"
- Leave love notes (use Lovebae's love letter feature!)

**What to avoid:**
- Criticism, especially in public
- Forgetting to acknowledge their efforts
- Dismissive responses like "whatever"
- Long periods of silence
- Sarcasm that cuts

### Example Phrases:
- "I'm so proud of you for..."
- "You look amazing today"
- "I appreciate how you always..."
- "What I love most about you is..."
- "You make my life better by..."

## Quality Time

### What It Means

Quality time lovers feel most loved when they have their partner's undivided attention. It's not just about being in the same room — it's about being present and engaged.

- They get upset when you're distracted during conversations
- They suggest activities to do together

### How to Speak This Language:

- Plan regular date nights
- Do activities together (cooking, walking, games)
- Have meaningful conversations

**What to avoid:**

## Acts of Service

### What It Means

For these partners, actions speak louder than words. They feel loved when you do things that make their life easier, especially tasks they dislike or don't have time for.

### Signs This Is Your Partner's Language:
- They notice and appreciate when you help with chores
- They often do things for you unprompted
- They feel unloved when you don't help out
- "Let me do that for you" makes them melt
- They feel stressed when tasks pile up

### How to Speak This Language:

**Daily practices:**
- Do a chore they usually handle
- Make their coffee/breakfast
- Fill their car with gas
- Pick up groceries they need
- Handle something stressful for them

**What to avoid:**
- Promising to help but not following through
- Making them ask for help repeatedly
- Leaving messes for them to clean
- Ignoring obvious things that need doing
- Adding to their workload

### Acts of Service Ideas:
- Cook dinner when they're tired
- Do their least favorite chore
- Run an errand for them
- Plan and execute a date
- Handle a stressful task they've been avoiding

## Receiving Gifts

### What It Means

This language isn't about materialism — it's about thoughtfulness. Gift lovers feel most loved when they receive tangible symbols of love, especially when the gift shows you were thinking about them.

### Signs This Is Your Partner's Language:
- They get excited about gifts, big or small
- They remember and cherish gifts they've received
- They give thoughtful gifts to others
- They notice when you pick something up "just because"
- They display or keep meaningful gifts

### How to Speak This Language:

**Daily practices:**
- Bring home their favorite snack
- Give flowers (or their equivalent) randomly
- Pick up something that reminded you of them
- Remember gift-giving occasions
- Wrap things nicely — presentation matters

**What to avoid:**
- Forgetting important gift-giving occasions
- Giving generic or thoughtless gifts
- Not putting effort into presentation
- Dismissing gift-giving as unimportant
- Last-minute panic gifts

### Gift Ideas (Not About Money):
- Their favorite candy bar
- A book they mentioned wanting
- Something for a hobby they love
- A handwritten letter (a gift of words!)
- A playlist you made for them
- Something from a place they love

## Discovering Your Love Languages

### Take the Quiz Together

Set aside time to take the official love languages quiz together. Discuss your results and what resonated.

### Observe Patterns

**How do you express love?** You often speak your own language.

**What hurts most when missing?** That's probably your primary language.

**What do you request most often?** "I wish you would..." reveals your needs.

### Have the Conversation

Ask each other:
- "What makes you feel most loved?"
- "What hurts you most when I forget to do it?"
- "When have you felt most loved by me?"

## Making It Work: The Daily Practice

### 1. Learn Both Languages

You need to know both your language AND your partner's.

### 2. Speak Theirs First

Even if it doesn't come naturally, prioritize their language.

### 3. Communicate Your Needs

Don't expect them to guess. Tell them what you need.

### 4. Check In Regularly

Languages can shift over time. Have regular conversations about what's working.

### 5. Use Tools to Help

Lovebae's features naturally support all five languages:

## Common Mistakes

### "But That's Not MY Language"

Your job is to speak THEIR language, not yours. It requires effort and intention.

### "They Should Just Know"

They can't. Communicate clearly what you need.

### "One and Done"

Knowing the languages is the start, not the end. Daily practice is what matters.

### "We're Incompatible"

Different languages don't mean incompatibility. They mean you need to learn something new.

## The Real Secret

Love languages are a tool, not a rigid rule. The real magic happens when you:
- Pay attention to what makes your partner feel loved
- Communicate what you need
- Make daily effort, even when it's hard
- Stay curious about each other
- Prioritize their feeling loved over being "right"
